 <!-- The Core Concept -->
The core concept is to create a dynamic and interactive web application that bridges data science/analytics with a user-friendly web interface. The application's purpose is to transform raw data (or analytical models) into actionable insights accessible via a browser, eliminating the need for complex software installations.


<!-- Overall Intentions of the Project -->
Simplify Access: To provide easy access to complex data and models through a simple web interface.

Enable Decisions: To generate clear, reliable visualizations and metrics that allow users to make informed decisions quickly.

Ensure Quality: To establish distinct roles (especially QA and Data Specialist) that guarantee the application is both technically sound and analytically accurate.
